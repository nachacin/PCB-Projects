# PCB-Projects

A PCB I designed during work with Schulichâ€™s Solar Car Team. The board implements a physical adapter between Molex and DB9 connectors for a CAN bus node with selectable terminating resistors through the 3-pin header. As commonly practiced, CAN tracks were routed as a differential pair to bolster signal integrity.
